You can only control the horizontal movement of the ball. There is a timer that measures your run time. 

Your goal is to reach the end of the map by following the level design. For vertical movement use the bounce tiles that are represented by the small hill tiles. Water tiles will kill you and cause the game to reset your position back to the starting point. Guns will shoot a bullet periodically, if it hits the ball you will die and be reset to the start. 

You can choose between two difficulty level, easy or hard, each one will dictate how many guns there will be and whether some blocks will appear throughout your playthrough.

Try and beat your best time!
