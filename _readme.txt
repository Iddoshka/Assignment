You can only control the horizontal movement of the ball. There is a timer that measures your run time. 

Your goal is to reach the opposite side of the map following the level design. For vertical movement use the bounce tiles that are represented by the little hill icons. Water tiles will kill you and cause the game to reset your position back to the starting position.

Try and beat your best time!
